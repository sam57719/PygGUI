# PygGUI - Pygame GUI Module - WORK IN PROGRESS
PygGUI is a simple Pygame GUI module.

## Current Features
- UI Manager - Can be used with an existing pygame gameloop or can itself be the main gameloop.
- Label - Simple text label

## Example code
I have one example program in the `tests/` folder in this repo.

## How do I install it?
Download the zipped file, and unzip it.
Enter the unzipped folder and you should see a `setup.py` script:
Open a terminal/command prompt here and run the following command:
```
pip install .
```
This will run the setup.py script and install the module onto your computer. 
Now you can import the module into any python script.
